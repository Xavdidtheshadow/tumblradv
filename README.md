tumblradv
=========
This is a search app that allows you to search/filter posts from a single tumblr user. It started as a school project and was expanded later to take on a life of its own. It's made to run through the Google [app engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), so it won't work in other contexts.

You can filter for any of the following types of posts in addition to searching for keywords:
-Regular
-Quote
-Q&A
-Link
-Photo

You can see it in motion at <http://tumblradv182.appspot.com/>.
